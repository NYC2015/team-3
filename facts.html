                                    <h4>Symptoms can include:</h4>
                                    <h4 style = "font-weight:normal;"><ul>Fever (this is the most common symptom)</ul></h4>

                                    <h4 style = "font-weight:normal;"><ul>Sore throat</ul></h4>

                                    <h4 class="section-heading", style = "font-weight:normal;"><ul>Headache</ul></h4>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">These symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks.
                        You should not assume you have HIV just because you have any of these symptoms. Each of these symptoms can be caused by other illnesses. And some people who have HIV do not show any symptoms at all for 10 years or more.
                        If you think you may have been exposed to HIV, get an HIV test. Most HIV tests detect antibodies (proteins your body makes against HIV), not HIV itself. But it takes a few weeks for your body to produce these antibodies, so if you test too early, you might not get an accurate test result. A new HIV test is available that can detect HIV directly during this early stage of infection. So be sure to let your testing site know if you think you may have been recently infected with HIV.</h4>

                            <h4 class="section-heading">HIV is spread mainly by having sex or sharing injection drug equipment such as needles with someone who has HIV.

                                Only certain fluids—blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk—from an HIV-infected person can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe) for transmission to possibly occur. Mucous membranes can be found inside the rectum, the vagina, the opening of the penis, and the mouth.
